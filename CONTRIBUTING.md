# Contributing to Fellowbook

We love input from our fellow Fellows! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. This applies to:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing our code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests only. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Send us your pull request.
5. If it looks good, we'll merge!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[See this bug report example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626). Good bug Reports tend to have:

- Overview and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes/miscellaneous comments

**We love thorough bug reports!**

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

While this is a Hackathon project, we'll standarize the style and expect you to follow this style. Stay tuned for more information!
